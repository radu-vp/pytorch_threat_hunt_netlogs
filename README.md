# Threat Detection Using Deep Learning

DataCamp project that consists of developing a tool using PyTorch and neural network models, with
capabilities to assist in threat hunting in network traffic logs, which can be adapted in order to
perform real-time anomaly detection and improve security posture.

## Requirements

* Python 3.11 or above
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* torch
* torchmetrics

## Installation Guide

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-venv
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ python3 -m venv cybersec
$ source cybersec/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
$ python3 main.py
# Deactivate the virtual environment after using
$ deactivate
```
